This a computer game with very simple rules.
The user sees a figure on the left and a target on the right.
The object of the game is to rotate the figure to the same orientation as the target.
There are versions of the game in two, three and four dimensions.

Each game has a 'demo' mode showing rotating figures. In 4D this allows the viewing of pretty patterns and experimenting with different viewing methods.
The figures can be be viewed with varying perspective, varying stereo effect and in both wire-frame and intersection modes.
